### Downloads

**Stable builds** can be downloaded from the [releases section](https://github.com/shungitescasa/tinyrino/releases/latest).

To test new features, you can download the **nightly build** [here](https://github.com/shungitescasa/tinyrino/releases/tag/nightly-build).

<!--Windows users can install Chatterino7 [from Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/chatterino7).-->

### Issues

If you have issues such as crashes or weird behaviour regarding TinyEmotes features, report them [in the issue-section](https://github.com/shungitescasa/tinyrino/issues). If you have issues with other features, please report them [in the upstream issue-section](https://github.com/Chatterino/chatterino2/issues).

### AVIF Support

When building Tinyrino, you might not have access to a static build of `libavif`. In that case, you can define `CHATTERINO_NO_AVIF_PLUGIN` in CMake. If you have `qavif.so` from [kimageformats](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kimageformats) installed on your system, Chatterino will pick it up and use AVIF images.

## Git blame

This project has big commits in the history which touch most files while only doing stylistic changes. To improve the output of git-blame, consider setting:

```shell
git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
```

This will ignore all revisions mentioned in the [`.git-blame-ignore-revs`
file](./.git-blame-ignore-revs). GitHub does this by default.

## Code style

The code is formatted using [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html). Our configuration is found in the [.clang-format](.clang-format) file in the repository root directory.

For more contribution guidelines, take a look at [the wiki](https://wiki.chatterino.com/Contributing%20for%20Developers/).

## Doxygen

Doxygen is used to generate project information daily and is available [here](https://doxygen.chatterino.com).
